## Prompt

(Generated by `/sp.tasks` command - no user input)

## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive 90-task breakdown for Docusaurus Phase 1 (4-5 hour window) organized by 6 prioritized user stories. Tasks structured as 9 phases: Setup → Foundational (CRITICAL GATE) → 6 user stories → Polish. All 90 tasks follow strict checklist format with IDs, story labels, and file paths. Parallel opportunities identified for Setup (5 tasks), Foundational (6 tasks), and user story groups (24 tasks parallelizable).

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Tasks are immediately executable with zero ambiguity; each task is atomic, independently testable, and traceable to specific user story and success criterion. Checkpoint-based structure enables MVP validation at multiple gates. Parallel execution opportunities identified for multi-developer teams.
- 🧪 Tests: Format validation PASS (all 90 tasks follow T### [P?] [Story] format with file paths); Independence check PASS (6 user stories independently testable); Parallel analysis identified 33+ parallelizable tasks; Checkpoint validation confirms 6 decision gates before handoff to Phase 2.
- 📁 Files: specs/1-docusaurus-setup/tasks.md (400+ lines, 90 tasks, 9 phases, 6 checkpoints, parallel opportunities documented, execution timeline provided)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Begin implementation starting with Phase 1 Setup (T001-T005); use docusaurus-initializer skill for T006; execute all tasks sequentially or in parallel per guidance
- 🧠 Reflection: Task breakdown balances specificity (every task has file path, success criterion, estimated time) with flexibility (parallel opportunities enable multi-developer coordination). Checkpoint-driven approach allows validation of each user story independently before proceeding. 4-5 hour Phase 1 allocation achievable with parallel execution: Setup 1h + Foundational 1-2h + User Stories 1h (parallel) + Polish 0.5h = 4-5h total. MVP strategy (US1 + US5 only) achievable in 2-3 hours if time-constrained.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None in task generation; potential execution risks: Task T014 (pnpm start) might fail with Node/pnpm version issues (mitigated by adding version check task); Task T064 (GitHub Actions) might fail with permission errors (mitigated by documenting GitHub Pages settings).
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Task Format Validation: PASS (all 90 tasks properly formatted); User Story Independence: PASS (US1-US6 independently testable); Checkpoint Completeness: PASS (6 checkpoints after major story groups); Parallel Opportunities: 33+ identified and labeled [P].
- Prompt variant (if applicable): User input was `/sp.tasks` (standard execution); no special variations needed.
- Next experiment: During implementation, measure actual time per phase against estimates (Setup 1h, Foundational 1-2h, each User Story 0.5h). If Setup or Foundational runs long, trim US2+US3+US6 and prioritize US1+US4+US5 (core MVP).
