# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action Models

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models represent the frontier of embodied AI, enabling robots to understand visual scenes and natural language instructions to take physical actions.

## Module Overview

- **Duration**: 9-10 lessons
- **Prerequisites**: Modules 1-3 (ROS 2, Gazebo, Isaac Sim)
- **Skills**: Multimodal AI, foundation models, embodied reasoning

## What You'll Learn

1. **Multimodal Architectures**: Vision transformers and language models
2. **Foundation Models for Robotics**: Pre-trained models (OpenAI CLIP, others)
3. **Action Prediction**: From vision-language to robot control
4. **Training and Fine-tuning**: Adapting VLA models to robots
5. **Real-World Deployment**: Deploying VLA models on robots
6. **Evaluation and Benchmarking**: Assessing robot performance

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand VLA model architectures
- Use pre-trained vision-language models
- Fine-tune models for robotic tasks
- Design end-to-end learning pipelines
- Deploy VLA systems on physical robots
- Evaluate and improve robot performance

## Tools and Setup

- **Frameworks**: PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers
- **Models**: CLIP, GPT-4V, Gato, and others
- **Hardware**: NVIDIA GPU (RTX 3090+, A100)
- **Integration**: ROS 2, Isaac Sim, real robots
